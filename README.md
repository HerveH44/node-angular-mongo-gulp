# Gulp, browser-sync, Node.js and MongoDB for AngularJS, Bootstrap front-end


## Description

This is a project skeleton to quickly start your project. It's composed of a nodejs backend server used to host a RESTful api using express and mongoose, and a frontend AngularJS application with ui-router. Gulp is used as the build management system, with browser-sync used to serve static files.


## Installation

Get the sources:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexwakeman/node-angular-mongo-gulp.git
```

### NodeJS

In order to start the nodejs server, we need express and mongoose dependencies.

In the `server/` directory, install the nodejs dependencies:
```bash
alex@home:server$ npm install
```

### AngularJS

Install Gulp dependencies including browser-sync:
```bash
alex@home:$ npm install
```

Use Gulp to build your JavaScript sources into app/js/concat/app.js, and open browser-sync:
```bash
alex@home$ gulp
```

You should see:
```bash
alex@home:$ gulp
[16:35:19] Using gulpfile ~/node-angular-mongo-gulp/gulpfile.js

```

## Usage

### Server (HTTP)

Uses gulp-browserify to serve up static angular files at http://localhost:3000

### Server (RESTful API)

The nodejs server is only used as a RESTful API. It is not meant to be used as a HTTP server delivering the Angularjs application.

Starts the nodejs application:
```bash
node server/app.js
```

You should see:
```bash
alex@home:/var/www/angular/template$ node server/app.js 
[INFO] Your project API started on port 4001
[DB] Successfully connected to: mongodb://localhost/template
```

### Client

Open your browser on `http://localhost:3000/`, but should open with browser-sync
